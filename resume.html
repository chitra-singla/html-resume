<h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Chitra Singla - a B.Tech. CSE student at JMIT. My strong interest and curiosity towards technology were the direct reasons that led me to choose this course. Through various experiences, I have developed a diverse skill set that I believe can be valuable in a range of settings. My freelancing work with Craftooholics allowed me to enhance my skills in graphic designing, content strategy, and content writing. During my internship with Pregrad & Younity.in, I developed strong communication skills, as well as abilities in sales and decision-making. Additionally, my previous startup experience allowed me to gain valuable skills in customer acquisition, customer convincing, sourcing, and networking. Currently, I'm a team member of NIDU and worked on a project with Relinns Technologies, where I contributed as team lead for content strategising & graphic designing. Right now, I'm leading a live project with Uphill Education. I aspire to be a successful professional in field of computer science and engineering because of my passion for problem solving, analytical thinking and creating practical solutions that can make a social impact.
